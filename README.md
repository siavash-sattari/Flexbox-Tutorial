As you know, the concept of FlexBox or Flexible Box is a model for layering web pages in website design, which helps us to design flexible and ultimately responsive pages without using float or positioning.

<br/>
<br/>

If you are familiar with the layering of web pages, you have definitely come across the flaws in the float feature that can be solved with the help of the clearfix feature. Fortunately, with the help of Flexbox, these problems can be solved to a large extent, and in addition, it provides us with many other features that are fully discussed in this e-book and all my efforts were made to ensure that while writing this book Electronically, I use the most up-to-date and professional educational method.

<br/>

A lot of time and energy has been spent to prepare this training and I request you to share this training with other friends if it is useful for you. I hope that through this training, I can help you increase your skills in front-end and learn Flexbox more professionally.
